## 👋 Hi, I’m a beginner data engineer, data analyst, and applied machine learning practitioner

I work at the intersection of data infrastructure, data understanding, and real-world machine learning deployment.
My main interest is not only building models, but building **end-to-end data systems** — from raw data collection, to analysis, to production-ready ML pipelines.

---

### 🧩 How I think about data

I see data work as a continuous pipeline:
- **Data Engineering** — designing reliable data pipelines and infrastructure  
- **Data Analysis** — transforming data into insight and decision support  
- **Applied Machine Learning** — turning models into usable systems  
Rather than treating these as separate roles, I focus on how they connect into one workflow.

### 🧠 What “beginer” means to me

I’m at an early stage of my professional journey, but I focus on:
- Strong fundamentals over shortcuts  
- System-level understanding over isolated tools  
- Long-term learning over quick hype

### 🛠️ Tools & interests

- Data: Python, Pandas, SQL, Spark  
- ML: scikit-learn, applied NLP, model evaluation  
- Systems: data pipelines, automation, reproducibility
